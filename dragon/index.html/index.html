     <h1>Dragon Vehicle Overview</h1>
<p>Dragon is a free-flying spacecraft designed to deliver both cargo and people to orbiting destinations. Dragon made history in 2012 when it became
the first commerical spacecraft in history to deliver cargo to the International Space Station and safely return to Earth, a feat previously 
achieved only by governments. It is the only spacecraft currently flying that is capable of returning significant amounts of cargo to Earth.
Currently Dragon carries cargo to space, but it was designed from the beginning to carry humans. Under an agreement with NASA, SpaceX is now developing
the refinements that will enable Dragon to fly crew. Dragon's first manned test flight is expected to take place as early as 2018.

<h2>
    Company Background
</h2>
<p> SapceX designs, manufactures, and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft. The company was founded in 2002 to revolutionize space technology,
with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets.
</p>

    <h2>
       Configurations
    </h2>
    <p>The Dragon spacecraft has three configurations to meet a variety of needs: cargo, crew and DragonLab. To ensure a rapid transition from cargo to crew capability, the cargo and crew configurations of Dragon are almost identical. This commonality simplifies the human rating process, allowing systems critical to crew and space station safety to be fully tested on unmanned cargo flights. With DragonLab, essentially the same spacecraft can be used as a platform for in-space technology demonstrations and experiments.</p>
